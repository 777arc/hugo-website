GNU Radio documentation can be found in several places throughout the internet. Most "user" level documentation such as block usage, tutorials, example applications, and guides can be found in the [GNU Radio Wiki](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/).  

A great place to start for someone totally new are the [Guided Tutorials](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Tutorials).

For someone with basic GNU Radio experience, but looking to create their own blocks and become an expert, we highly recommend going through each page in the [Usage Manual](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Usage_Manual).

For API documentation please consult the [Doxygen documentation](https://www.gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen).
