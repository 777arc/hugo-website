GNU Radio's documentation is in the process of getting a significant reorganization to improve the experience for both newcomers and experts alike. This talk covers the current state and future plans for the user manual and wiki based documentation. As the documentation must serve the needs of a wide variety of users, Marc will be polling the audience about specific features and use cases. There will also be a report about the updated Comprehensive GNU Radio Archive Network (CGRAN) website, a free open source repository for 3rd party GNU Radio applications which is maintained by the GNU Radio project. The talk will be complemented by a working group session on Friday.
