This talk will explore the development of the bladeRF's modular and portable open source Automatic Gain Control. Tradeoffs between gain selection strategies, hardware limitations, waveforms requirements, and calibration routines will be discussed. The talk will also briefly introduce the bladeRF 2.0 micro which, even with an ASIC AGC, benefits from having a standardized software (HDL) based AGC as an alternative.
