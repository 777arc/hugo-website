In this update from Ettus Research R&D, we will first discuss open problems in the realm of SDR in general, and take a look at items the author considers to be relevant issues for software defined radio in the upcoming years. From there, we will take a look at current projects Ettus Research is undertaking and see how it is contributing to open problems of the SDR domain.
