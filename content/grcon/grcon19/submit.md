# Call for Submissions

GNU Radio Conference celebrates and showcases the substantial and remarkable progress of the world's best open source digital signal processing framework for software-defined radios. In addition to presenting GNU Radio’s vibrant theoretical and practical presence in academia, industry, the military, and among amateurs and hobbyists, GNU Radio Conference 2019 will have a very special focus.

Summer 2019 marks the 50th anniversary of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, which landed the first humans on the Moon. GNU Radio Conference selected Huntsville, AL, USA as the site for GNU Radio Conference 2019 in order to highlight and celebrate space exploration, astronomical research, and communication. 

Space communications are challenging and mission critical. Research and development from space exploration has had and continues to have far-reaching effect on our communications gear and protocols. 

We invite developers and users from the GNU Radio Community to present your projects, presentations, papers, posters, and problems at GNU Radio Conference 2019. Submit your talks, demos, and code! Please share this Call for All with anyone you think needs to read it. 

## Submitting 

You may make one or more submissions under the following categories for presentation at GRCon. In addition to submitting a presentation, you may submit a paper to the Technical Proceedings of GRCon19. **You do not need to submit a paper to the Proceedings in order to present at GRCon.**

**Talks** are 20-30 minutes long, including 5 minutes reserved for questions. Each presentation should be a slide-deck that can be shared publicly (PDF) after the conference. For presentations that are technical in nature, talks that present real-world development / testing will be favored over simulation-only work.

**Tutorials** are 40 minutes long, and should have an educational or “How-To” approach. If slides are used, they should be publicly shareable (PDF) after the conference. Demonstrations or “real-time examples” are welcome!

**Posters** can display any type of material that you believe is interesting to the community, and while most posters are technical, they don’t have to be. There is no poster template, so you can create whatever layout you would like. Poster easels will be provided.

To submit your content for the conference, visit our dedicated conference submission site at:

https://openconf.org/GRCon19/openconf.php

## Dates

First round closes **1 July 2019**. If accepted, your content will be immediately scheduled.  
Final round closes **1 September 2019**. Space permitting.

If you have questions or need assistance with OpenConf, or have content that doesn't quite fit and you want to talk it over, please write grcon@gnuradio.org 

If your submission is accepted, you **must** register for the conference or your talk will be dropped from the schedule.

Please note that submitting a paper to the Technical Proceedings is **not** required to submit a Talk, Tutorial, or Poster, but is **strongly** encouraged. You also do **not** need to attend the conference to publish in the Technical Proceedings.
